This is An Application that uses API for displaying different types of mobile phones to an end user. You can see details, buy, delete items from your card, add new items with photo related to the item.I used core principles of object-oriented programming. 
I have used JavaScript and React concepts with CSS and HTML. For better functioning I used useGlobalContext,multiple React Hooks, react-router-dom, classes, encapsulation and polymorphism.
 You can find this application deployed on Netlify: "https://storepet-5ece3.web.app/" It's working for both mobile and web.
